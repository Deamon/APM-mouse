# APM-mouse

Ever heard of APM (actions per minute) and EPM (effective actions per minute) in Warcraft and Starcraft? 

For the good old times's sake, here's some practice in seconds

Enjoy: http://yanshuoh.github.io/APM-mouse/

## Downloads
* Available in npm: npm install APM-mouse
* git clone: https://github.com/YanshuoH/APM-mouse.git

## Modules
This is a self-training project, built with ReactJS, Sass and Gulp.

## Building
Since there's no server-side, see package.json
```
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp build # build dist files once, or
gulp # watch for changes
```
Also, as one of the vendor uses compass, you may want to install Gem/Compass/Gulp-compass for building as well.
Help yourself with Ruby-GEM and Compass-compile, I've only uploaded a dist file in this repo, using it as a static css file.

## Browser
Tested with Chrome 37 and above, Firefox 37.
IE 8 failed. (Seems like ReactJS does not like IE8)

## Todos
* In comming responsive support for tablets.
* and so on
